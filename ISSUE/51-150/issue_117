"""Government should not fund any scientific research whose consequences, either medical or ethical, are unclear."""
"The government of a country shoulders a great responsibility of keeping its populace happy. For the betterment of its people, there are times when the government has to make decisions that are met with severe criticism. There are chances that some decisions go against the nation in the long run and the government is later apologetic about it. In some cases, the impact of a decision of one country is felt by other nations as well. It is, thus, very essential that a government keeps in mind the goodwill of its people, and the world as a whole, before any decisions are taken. This is exceptionally true for a government in matters related with scientific research. Where I do not completely agree with the views of the author, I cannot disagree with him either. In my view, deep contemplation should precede any decision making regarding research and regular checks during the research should ensure that medical and ethical consequences are foreseen."
"It is only through research that we can make progress. Scientific research is like a chain reaction and one invention or discovery leads to another. In most cases, discoveries are accidental but inventions are a result of directed efforts. A discovery in itself is not sufficient, it is only after research is carried out that the true potential of a thing is realized and exploited. One cannot limit oneself while researching unless there are set objectives that one is trying to achieve. Scientific research is not only for the purpose of inventing something new; it is, in fact, a means of increasing one's knowledge about the various advancements taking place all around the world. How else would any country be able to make use of any development taking place anywhere in the world?"
"Since the progress of any nation depends on its government, it becomes obligatory for the government to fund research work. Where funding projects is important, it is equally vital for the government to keep a track about whatever research is happening. There are some medical and ethical questions that are always associated with research work, but mostly we have to overlook such issues. For instance, one cannot do away with experimenting on rats for research purpose until an equally good substitute is found. Besides, a government has to decide pragmatically what gains priority."
"In most cases, the results of research work are unclear. It is only when experimentation is carried out and observations are made, that the true value of a research is brought out. It is nearly impossible to work upon a subject if the minds of researchers are restricted and their funds are limited. In my view, research should be funded, but the medical and ethical consequences should be weighed from time to time. It is not wise to freeze funds before any headway is made and consequences are apparent. Take for instance cloning. We all know that cloning of humans would lead to unimaginable tribulations. There is no point in a country's investing in such research. Nonetheless, cloning endangered species shall help conserve them. For this purpose, it becomes necessary for a country to research in this direction."
"In today's world, it is essential that every nation be independent in terms of scientific research and technological advancement. Countries that have progressed in science and technology are the ones that are the most developed and powerful. Some developing and underdeveloped nations lack the infrastructure and funds to support research while others like U.S.A. are leaders in scientific development. At the same time, the governing body of a country should be abreast with what the scientific fraternity of the country is doing and should impose restrictions wherever necessary."
