"""The intellectual benefits of attending a university or college are vastly overrated: most people could learn more by studying and reading on their own for four years than by pursuing a university or college degree."""
"The author of the above statement advocates that studying on ones own is more beneficial than studying in an educational institution for a degree level course. Though time and effort are required for studying in an institution, I do not agree with the author that attending college can be done away with."
"Colleges and universities offer a vast variety of courses. While some subjects require little attention, there are those that demand hard work and dedication. Take for instance, a degree course in physics. It is not possible for an average student to understand all the concepts that are new to him on his own. He needs a guide and a mentor who can direct his studies, channel his energy, explain concepts to him, share his own experiences and consequently make the course easier for him. When any person undertakes a task or undergoes an experience for the first time, there are bound to be obstacles in his way. If he is made to undergo the same the next time around, he shall certainly find some amount of relative ease. Moreover, over repeated exercise he shall be able to guide a novice as well. A student who starts college level education, thus, gains from the experience and expertise of his teachers."
"Besides, attending college brings about subtle changes in the personality of a student. He learns certain social skills that he cannot hope to learn in any other setting. Most importantly, he learns how to cooperate and compete with his fellow mates. The experiences he has in college better prepare him for working as an employee."
"As opposed to attending college, the idea of staying at home and pursuing a degree course has its own benefits. When a person is left on his own, he is likely to apply his own brain to gain knowledge. He struggles to acquire knowledge and clarify concepts. This brings in him independence and deeper understanding of concepts, in most cases. He saves on spending time in commuting to college and attending classes. For an above average student whose understanding and retention are better than those of an average student are, this saving can be exceptionally valuable. Such a student can channel his energies and learn more by putting his time to good use. Moreover, the amount of money that he spends on commuting to college and for attending a regular course can be beneficial for buying some more study materials that he might require. He can have his own routine of studying and can make a choice of the pattern he wants to follow for completing the syllabus."
"If a comparison were drawn between the two methods of studying, I would give preference to attending a college or university. The presence of a mentor cannot be undervalued. He steers your energy in the correct direction and keeps a check on you.  While studying independently, any child can go astray and end up spending time and energy in ineffectual pursuits. He could even misunderstand concepts for want of timely checks. Building up concepts on misunderstood basics could result in huge loses. Moreover, in the absence of expert guidance, a student could be in the lurch quiet often. This would lead to his getting disillusioned, spoiling his course of study, wandering from one source to another and getting confused, only credit to the absence of a guide. Moreover, he would end up wasting money and time."
"Instead of completely doing away with attending a university or college, a middle path could be adopted, wherein average and above average students could be given some independence of choosing their method of study. They could attend or miss college as per choice. Besides, they could follow the syllabus completion schedule decided upon by the college, clarify their doubts, and be in accord with the college routine. Such an alternative could help students pursue additional courses or part time jobs, which would help them earn and learn at the same time."
