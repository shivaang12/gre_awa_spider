"""Technology is a necessary but not always a positive force in modern life."""
Technology has been a boon to mankind and it is a blessing in disguise. It has made the life of humans simple and easy to live. The effects of technology have largely been positive on human life. We have reached this modern era because of technology. The various technologies around us have made this world modern. In this modern life technological innovations have become integral to our lives Technological innovations are the most important aspect of human life and it is impossible to even think of our life without them. Technology is the greatest creation of humans and it has also enabled humans to create whatever they desire. I think that technology is indispensable in our modern life and it is a great positive force in our lives.
The creativity in the field of technology has always resulted in remarkable innovations. We would not have reached such heights of development without the help of technology. Technology has influenced people in a positive sense. It has instigated people to create better and better innovations. We can never think of our lives without the basic amenities which technology has provided us with. Without such technology we would still be in the pre-historic age. We should be thankful to technology for our metamorphosis from a cave man to the modern man of present age. This modernism is the result of technology and it has made our life better and better with time. It is best tool that the humans have ever invented for self help. The technological inventions from a mixer grinder to the aircrafts have revolutionized the human life. Technology has aided the humans with the power to create anything and this is a process which is still going on with the hope of creating something new and better.
"Although the positive influence of technology on our lives is credible but at the same time various drawbacks of technology can not be neglected. This tool of technology has proved to be a disaster in the hands of scientists who made inventions which were not in favor of mankind. One such invention is cloning and if it is ever used on humans then it could be disastrous. With the help of technology we should not play with nature. Certain things should remain as they are and humans should not tamper with them. Another deadly innovation that resulted from technology is nuclear bombs 
and weapons which are again against mankind. Such inventions can destroy the very existence of man himself. What is the use of such technology which would prove to be fatal for a human himself? That means ultimately the development in the technological front is not making us modern instead we are creating and inventing technology which would erase the very existence of mankind."
"Therefore, technology is beneficial to mankind till the time it is not misused. The negative aspects of technology can certainly not be overlooked but it is on us to decide how to make the best possible use of technology."
