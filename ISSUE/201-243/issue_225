"""Students should bring a certain skepticism to whatever they study. They should question what they are taught instead of accepting it passively."""
"Knowledge flows from a learned to a learner. A school or college is an educational institute where teachers are the learned and students are the learners. Although, teaching and learning is a two way process between a teacher and a student, it is the teacher with whom lies the responsibility of imparting education."
"Students are naive and ignorant about the ways and means of gaining knowledge. There are endless topics and subjects completely new to them. It is not possible for them to choose and decide what they need to study. Only the one, who are thorough with these topics, can decide how to make them easy and interesting for the students at different levels. They are better at selecting or rejecting a certain portion of the topics, depending on its relevance and importance."
"For instance, in lower classes the learning of formulae in mathematics and science and rules of grammar in languages may not be comprehended well by students. It is not easy to explain to them the reasons for those rules, at such an early age. Even derivation of mathematical formulae for young children will prove to be a waste of effort. To ease the burden of students, the curriculum for different levels is framed by trained professionals. The difficulty level, the selection of topics, division of lessons along with a link with previous and next standards is looked after by the experts who frame the curriculum. Students who do not even have complete knowledge of any topic are not at all in a position to make a decision. "
"Instead of being skeptic about the topics being taught, they should welcome all the new things and clear their doubts wherever necessary. There are times when the queries of the students cannot be answered due to time constraints or their inability to understand the real details. It is quite natural that due to an overly inquisitive and restless mind, some students come up with endless doubts and seek detailed explanation thereby distracting the whole class from the topic being discussed. Manipulating or ignoring them gently will be beneficial in enhancing the concentration on the topic and will also help in completing the syllabus on time. If for the sake of satisfying the students, teachers do not draw a limit, then no topic will ever be completed and understood fully. Therefore, along with the framed curriculum, it is the responsibility of the experienced lot (teachers) to proceed in the interest of the ignorant students."
"Moreover, encouraging a skeptic attitude in students would not only develop a negative attitude in them, but also build arrogance and indiscipline in them. It may also promote a rebellious nature on the slightest provocation due to their limited knowledge and emotional behavior. This will harm studies and put teachers in an awkward position."
"Although, at much higher levels of education, students may be given a right to question over some issues, it cannot be generalized. Thus, students as learners should have faith in the system and regard their teachers, as they have not earned the right to question the merits of either of them."
