"""Society does not place enough emphasis on the intellect-that is, on reasoning and other cognitive skills."""
"A society is a judge and its verdict is final. Whether it is related with politics, environment, sports, entertainment, economics or any other sphere, society decides what is to stay and what is to go, what is to be given importance and what is to be ignored. A society has great control over its people, its government and its nation. No government can progress if its society is not satisfied. No person can hope to gain fame if it does not win the hearts of people. In fact, the success of any person or thing is determined by how well society receives it."
"We need to appreciate that a society is generally divided into separate classes. The strength of these classes determines how the society reacts to situations, people, ideas, things, decisions, laws etc. If a society is dominated by economically weak people, the society on the whole shall make decisions favoring the interests of its poor people. Similarly, a society that is economically sound shall have corresponding preferences. Thus, the likes and dislikes of a society depend on its dominating populace. However, this influence is more rampant in matters related to socio-economic and political decisions. This influence is not extended to other aspects, especially when it comes to appreciating intellect and progressive thinking."
"Human beings in general prefer progress. Every individual yearns for progress and advancement. We all want that our tomorrow should be better than our today and our next generation builds up on what we have. It is for this basic intention of improving our lives that we have an innate appreciation for intellect. It is our appreciation of intellect that makes us appreciate the works of Einstein, Galileo, Newton, Aryabhatta etc, decades after they are gone."
"Apart from the scientific world, even in our day-to day lives, we emphasize on intelligence. Take for instance any child. He is likely to be recognized for his quick grasp of things rather than for other skill. In schools, children who are intelligent always have an edge over those who are remarkable in other activities. Besides, we prefer to be in the company of intelligent people, rather than talented people, for intelligence of others gives our own thought process a stimulation and we learn more in their company."
"It is not a wonder then that most great leaders of our societies are men who are intelligent. They are men who can find solutions to problems that are suitable to all. Were they not intelligent, they wouldn't be able to hold the trust of people for long. It is for this reason that we give more importance to intelligent and educated people. There is more value attached to a person who is educated and exhibits his intelligence in diverse situations than there is for a person who is uneducated and mediocre."
"As far as laying emphasis on cognitive skills is concerned, there is a lot that is being done by society. Intelligence is a measure for a person's worth; we encourage children to develop reasoning skills, schools and colleges grant scholarships and hold competitions to appreciate intelligent students, governments give financial aids to intelligent and innovative thinkers, debates and discussions among socially eminent personalities are a common sight in media. Thus, emphasis on cognitive skills is abundant but one cannot say whether it is enough or not. There is no means of measuring such a quantity and the word 'enough' is relative from person to person. What might be enough for a particular society or person might not be sufficient for another. Thus, this issue is more personal than general."
