"Many employees of major United States corporations are fearful that they will lose their jobs in the near future, but this fear is largely unfounded. According to a recent study, a majority of companies expected to make new hires in the coming year, while fewer companies expected to lay off employees. In addition, although it is very disturbing to be laid off, the proliferation of programs and of workshops designed to improve job-finding skills has made being laid off far less painful than it once was."
"The arguer claims that the apprehensions of many employees of major United States corporations that they may lose their current jobs in the near future are baseless. This statement is supported by evidence in the form of the results of a recent study that brings out that a majority of companies will be hiring new employees in the coming year. Additionally, the number of companies that may be discontinuing the services of their employees is very less. The argument further states that a large number of programs and workshops designed to improve job-finding skills have come up and this has eased the pain of losing one's job to a large extent. However, the reasons provided by the arguer are insufficient to support the claim being made."
"A major lacuna in the given argument is that the recent study brings out the employment related statistics for the coming year, whereas the fear of losing jobs is with respect to the near future. The term 'near future' has not been defined anywhere in the given argument. It has not be been specifically mentioned that 'near future' includes the coming year as well. Additionally, the results of the recent study are related only to the employment statistics for the coming year.  Therefore, utilizing the results of the study to state the fears of the employees as baseless is by and large unconvincing as these two facts cannot be related to each other."
"Moreover, the argument makes no mention of the specific fields in which there may not be a requirement of employees in the near future. It is quite possible that with the advent of technology, most corporations are procuring hi-tech machinery and therefore, their current employees are fearful of losing their jobs as they are not technically qualified to handle the new equipment. The corporations may have additional openings for technically qualified personnel who can handle the new machines. Therefore, the results of the survey that indicate a requirement of hiring employees do not suggest that the present employees need not fear losing their jobs."
"The statement that ""the proliferation of programs and of workshops designed to improve job-finding skills has made being laid off far less painful than it once was"", does nothing to alleviate the fears of the employees that they may lose their jobs in the near future. Just because there are numerous programs available for improving job-finding skills does not assure that it will be easy to get a new job. Additionally, this does not mean that one need not fear losing one's job. This is because getting employed is largely dependent on your qualifications and expertise and not on your job-finding skills. Therefore, this statement is flawed and it does not serve the purpose of strong evidence in support of the claim that the fears of the employees are baseless."
"The argument would have sounded convincing if it had included more evidence to support its claim that the employees are unnecessarily fearing that they will lose their jobs. In view of the above, it is evident that the given argument is largely flawed in its present form due to lack of sufficient evidence in its support."
