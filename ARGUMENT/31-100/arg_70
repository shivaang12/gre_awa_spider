The following appeared in a letter to the editor of a local newspaper.
"""The members of the town school board should not be reelected because they are not concerned about promoting high-quality education in the arts in our local schools. For example, student participation in the high school drama club has been declining steadily, and this year the school board refused to renew the contract of the drama director, even though he had received many awards for his original plays. Meanwhile, over $300,000 of the high school budget goes to athletic programs, and the head football coach is now the highest-paid member of the teaching staff."""
"The above article appeared as a letter to the editor of a local newspaper. The arguer recommends that the members should not be reelected of the town school board as they are not interested in promoting high-quality education in the arts in their local schools. The arguer makes further argument in support of his stand that in spite of the drama director receiving numerous awards for his original plays, his contract for this year was refused by the school board for renewal. Additionally the number of students participating in the high school drama club has been declining. The arguer further sates that on the other hand over $300,000 of the high school budget goes to the athletic programs and the highest paid member of the teaching staff is the head football coach. The arguments made by the arguer are vague and are not convincing."
"The first argument presented by the arguer in support of his recommendation is that student participation in high school drama is declining. This assumption is absolutely baseless as the lack of participation from the students could be due to other factors like the majority of the students must be studious or more interested in playing sports. The arguer does not mention whether arts only include drama. As there are also various forms of art there could be a possibility that the students are more inclined towards music, dance or painting. The arguer has not mentioned these areas of art education."
The arguer further states that the contract of the drama director was refused to be renewed by the board in spite of the drama director getting several awards for his original plays. This argument made by arguer is again baseless as the arguer has no where mentioned that drama director has done remarkably well in the field of dramatics in the school. Although he has earned many awards but he has not got a single award for the school. It is highly possible that students do not like the drama director and because of this reason the interest on the student's is declining.
"The arguer's next stand is the amount of budget allotted for the athletic programs and that the head football coach is now the highest-paid member of the teaching staff. This argument of the arguer is extremely baseless as the relation between athletic budget and arts budget is not mentioned. There are separate budgets for different departments and it is nowhere mentioned by the arguer that because of the athletic budget, arts budget is suffering. And also the arguer has not mentioned anywhere that because of more allocation of funds to the athletic programs students are not participating in the high school drama. The arguer has not mentioned whether the school board is partial towards athletic budget. The arguer mentions that the head of football coach is the highest paid member and the arguer nowhere mentions whether there is any problem with the coach getting so highly paid or anybody is objecting to it."
"The arguments made by the arguer in support of his stand are all without substantive explanation. Hence, this recommendation is absolutely baseless."
