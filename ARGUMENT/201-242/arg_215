The following was taken from a guide for aspiring writers.
"""New writers usually cannot convince large, prestigious publishers that their work is marketable, so they must first publish with smaller, less well-known presses to establish a sales record. But the editors of Mystery Writers Magazine have good news for aspiring writers: the number of mystery novels published in the last two years has grown significantly, and more people read mysteries than any other type of novel. In addition, almost half of the mystery novels published last year was written by first-time novel writers. Since there is apparently an expanding market for mystery novels, all publishers will want to increase the number of mystery novels they publish. Therefore, new writers should write mystery novels to increase their chances for first-time publication with a larger, prestigious company."""
"The above article was taken from a guide for aspiring writers. The arguer wants to suggest that new writers should write mystery novels to increase their chances for first-time publication with a larger, prestigious company. The arguer gives various reasons to support his argument. The first argument presented by the arguer is that new writers cannot convince large prestigious publishers so in order to establish their sales they should first publish with smaller and less well-known presses. The second argument presented by the arguer is that in the past two years people read more and more mystery novels and almost half were written by first-time novel writers. Finally, the arguer states that since market for mystery novel is expanding, all publishers want to increase their publication of mystery novels. Therefore, new writers should write mystery novels. The assumptions given by the arguer are extremely baseless therefore,  his recommendation should not be accepted."
The first argument presented by the arguer is that new writers are not able to impress big publishing houses so in stead they should first publish with smaller and less well-known presses. The assumption made by the arguer is absolutely baseless. If a new writer makes an attempt to write then he should try and get his writings published in an established publishing house. This way he will earn fame and it is not always necessary that prestigious publication houses do not entertain new writers; in stead they also keep looking for fresh ideas and talents.
The second argument presented by the arguer is that in the past two years people read more mystery novels and almost half were written by first-time novel writers. The arguer fails to mention whether those novels were published by prestigious publishing houses or small publishing houses. The arguer has also not specified whether the novels by new writers were a success or not. It is possible that the novels which were successful were by the experienced writers.
"Finally, the arguer states that since the market for mystery novel is expanding, all publishers want to increase there publication of mystery novels. Therefore, new writers should attempt writing mystery novels in order to get a chance from large publishing houses. The arguer assumes that the same trend of mystery novels would continue. It is very much possible that now public would demand something new and the public would demand for some other form of fiction. Again there is no surety that if a new writer attempts writing a mystery novel that would definitely be published by a big publishing house. It is also not clear whether people would prefer first time mystery novel writers or not as they would prefer their old experienced writers more. The arguer fails to bring into notice that a writer writes his own thoughts, preference, and convictions and nothing can be forced on him. If a writer is good at writing romantic novels he can not be made to write mystery novels."
"All the arguments presented by the arguer were not able to convince us. Therefore, the recommendation made by the arguer should not be accepted."
