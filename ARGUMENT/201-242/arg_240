"The nation of Claria covers a vast physical area. But despite wide geographic differences, many citizens are experiencing rising costs of electricity. A recent study of household electric costs in Claria found that families who cooled their houses with fans alone spent more on electricity than did families using air conditioners alone for cooling. However, those households that reported using both fans and air conditioners spent less on electricity than those households that used either fans or air conditioners alone. Thus, the citizens of Claria should follow the study's recommendation and use both air conditioners and fans in order to save money on electricity."
"The argument concludes that the citizens of Claria should use both air conditioners and fans as that would be the most appropriate method to save money on electricity. The arguer utilizes the findings of a recent study to bolster his recommendation. This recent study has found that families in Claria who use both air conditioners and fans to cool their homes spend less on electricity as compared to those who use either fans or air conditioners alone. However, the arguer ignores various aspects of electricity consumption, thereby rendering the given argument unconvincing in several respects."
"The reader would need more information about the study that has been conducted in order to be convinced that the conclusion made by the study is valid. In its present form, the findings of the study are largely dubious as the argument does not present any information related to the time frame and the season in which the study was conducted. If the study was conducted partly in summer and partly in winter, then there would be a variation in the electricity units consumed by the people for cooling their houses. At the same time, the argument should include information about the families who participated in the study and there is a need to justify the fact that these families represent the entire population of Claria."
"Moreover, the arguer has unfairly assumed that the weather is the same throughout Claria despite the fact that it has a vast area with conspicuous geographical differences. Therefore, there are likely to be certain areas in Claria which are cold or which have extreme weather conditions in different seasons. Therefore, people residing in such areas of Claria will require home cooling only for a couple of months every year.  It is likely that such people would have bought air conditioners and fans, but they do not use them as much and this would account for the less electricity consumption. Additionally, it is likely that the people using fans are those who reside in the high-altitude areas of Claria. Therefore, their expenditure on electricity would be high as they would be utilizing electricity for warming their houses more than for cooling. Hence, this could account for a high expenditure on electricity by the people who are using only fans for cooling. As it is a commonly known fact that air conditioners draw more electricity, recommending people living in warm areas to buy air conditioners along with fans will amount to an increase in their electricity costs since they would require using them throughout the year."
"The arguer has ignored the aspect related to the costs of electricity in different parts of Claria. It is likely that the people using both air conditioners and fans reside in areas of Claria where the costs of electricity are the minimum. At the same time, it is likely that the people using only fans reside in those areas of Claria where the costs of electricity are high."
"The argument needs to be substantiated by providing evidence that clearly establishes that the climate throughout Claria is the same despite the geographical differences in different areas of Claria. Moreover, there is a need to provide statistics related to the costs of electricity in different parts of Claria. In view of the above, it can be said that the given argument is grossly fallacious in light of the inadequate evidence in its support."
