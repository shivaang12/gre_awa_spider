"The following is from an editorial in the Midvale Observer, a local newspaper."
"""Ever since the 1950's when television sets began to appear in the average home, the rate of crimes committed by teenagers in the country of Alta has steadily increased. This increase in teenage crime parallels the increase in violence shown on television. According to several national studies, even very young children who watch a great number of television shows featuring violent scenes display more violent behavior within their home environment than do children who do not watch violent shows. Furthermore, in a survey conducted by the Observer, over 90 percent of the respondents were parents who indicated that prime-time television - programs that are shown between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. - should show less violence. Therefore, in order to lower the rate of teenage crime in Alta, television viewers should demand that television programmers reduce the amount of violence shown during prime time."""
"The above article appeared as an editorial in the Midvale Observer, a local newspaper. The arguer wants to recommends that in order to reduce the teenage crime rate in Alta, television viewers should demand that television programmers reduce the amount of violence shown during prime time. The arguer gives various arguments in support of his stand. The first argument presented by the arguer is that since the time television sets began to appear in the country of Alta the rate of crimes committed by teenagers in the country of Alta has steadily increased. The arguer further states that the increase in teenage crime parallels the increase in violence shown on television. The second argument presented by the arguer is that several national studies which indicate that even very young children who watch a great number of television shows featuring violent scenes display more violent behavior within their home environment than do children who do not watch violent shows. Finally, the arguer presents his stand based on a survey conducted by the Observer. According to the survey 90 percent of the respondents were parents who indicated that prime-time television programs should show less violence. The arguments presented by the arguer are not authenticated enough."
"The first argument presented by the arguer is that since the time television has been introduced in Alta, teenage crime rate has also increased. The arguer states that increase in teenage crime parallels the increase in violence shown on television. The arguer has not mentioned whether before the introduction of television there was any teenage crime. It is possible that teenage crimes existed but in that year reported cases would have been more. There can be other reasons for the increased crime rate. The arguer fails to mention the impact of other television shows on teenagers. The arguer has also not mentioned the percentage of teenagers who are committing crimes. The arguer has also not mentioned whether the trend was the same in the whole country or in some particular region."
The second argument presented by the arguer is based on a study which indicates that children who watch violent program on television display more violent behavior within their home than those children who do not watch such shows. The arguer has not mentioned about the teenage crime rates of all the countries where this study was conducted. It is also not necessary that if a child shows violent behavior then he will commit crimes also. There is a difference between exhibiting violent behavior and committing crimes.
"Finally, the arguer supports his arguments by mentioning about a survey conducted by the Observer where in 90 percent of the respondents were parents who indicated that prime-time television programs should show less violence. The arguer has not mentioned whether the parents who wanted less violent prime time programs were the parents of the teenagers who committed crimes. The arguer has also not mentioned about those teenagers who did not watch violent program on television as they might also be committing crimes."
"The arguments presented by the arguer are not convincing therefore, his recommendation should not be accepted."
