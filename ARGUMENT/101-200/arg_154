The following appeared in a memo from a manager of a car dealership.
"""Ten years ago, long-term car leasing became available in our country of Mohilia as an alternative to outright car ownership, and leasing has steadily risen in popularity. For each of the last five years, the number of people leasing new cars has surpassed the number buying new cars. The average age of cars driven in Mohilia is six years; hence, if new car leases again outnumber purchases this year, it is likely that the majority of drivers will be driving leased, not individually owned, cars. Therefore, we should change the focus of our business from selling cars to leasing them."""
The above article appeared as a memo from a manager of a car dealership. The arguer in the above article wants to recommend that in the country of Mohila the business focus should shift from selling cars to leasing cars. The arguer has given various arguments in favor of his stand. The first argument presented by the arguer is that long-term leasing is available in the country from the past ten years and has steadily risen in popularity since then. The arguer further presents his argument that the number of people leasing new cars has surpassed the number of people buying new cars. The final argument of the arguer in the support of his stand is that if in the present year the leased cars again outnumber purchased cars then majority of the drivers would be driving leased cars and therefore focus should be on leasing cars rather than selling cars.
The arguer in his first argument states that the leasing started in the country of Mohila ten years ago and since then it has been rising. The arguer has not given the reason why people in the country preferred to lease cars than purchasing them.The arguer has also not mentioned whether the same trend of leasing was dominant equally in the whole country or some part of the country was leading in leasing rather than purchasing cars. The arguer has not mentioned the reason why people in Mohila wanted to outright car ownership as owning a car has far more benefits than leasing one. The cost factor could be one of the reasons that people of the country prefer leasing rather than owning a car. The arguer has also not mentioned what percentage of cars are leased and owned.
The arguer also states that new cars were leased more in last five years. There could be numerous reasons for this. The economy of the country could be going through a low phase leaving people with the option of leasing cars. The other reason can be that some people wanted to change their cars and that's why they must be trying an old model of the same car first. A few unsatisfied prospective buyers must have opted out of buying new cars.
The arguer in his final argument states that if leasing cars again surpasses purchasing cars in the present year then the majority of the drivers would be driving leased cars. This assumption of the arguer is absolutely baseless. The arguer in the argument has not mentioned the exact number of people actually opting for leased cars. Moreover it is a hypothetical situation. The arguer should not base his decision merely on the basis of assumptions. Even if the hypothesis is correct then also it is not sure that a large number of cars on road would be leased cars.
The arguments presented by the arguer are flawed and are not well-reasoned. The arguer also bases his predictions on hypothetical analysis which is very vague. The arguer should present us with more relevant and acceptable facts.
