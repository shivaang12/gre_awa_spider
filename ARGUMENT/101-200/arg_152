"Copper occurs in nature mixed with other minerals and valuable metals in ore, and the proportion of copper in the ore can vary considerably. Until fairly recently, the only way to extract pure copper from ore was by using a process that requires large amounts of electric energy, especially if the proportion of copper in the ore is low. New copper-extracting technologies can use up to 40 percent less electricity than the older method to process the same amount of raw ore, especially when the proportion of copper in the ore is high. Therefore, we can expect the amount of electricity used by the copper-extraction industry to decline significantly."
In the above argument the arguer wants to support the new copper-extracting technologies. The arguer presents different arguments in support of his stand. The arguer presents us with the fact that the new copper-extracting technology uses 40 percent less electricity than the older method and especially when the proportion of copper is high in the ore. The arguer presents us with the argument that the new copper-extracting technologies would make the consumption of electricity decline.
The first argument by the arguer is dubious. The arguer states that the new method would take 40 percent less electricity to extract same amount of raw copper especially when the proportion of copper is high. This statement indicates that if the amount of copper is low then it might take more electricity. The arguer has not mentioned the credibility of the new technology under the circumstances when the copper proportion is low. The arguer fails to bring about the exact difference in the performance of the technologies as if the same amount of copper has to extract from the ore which has high copper content. There is a possibility that the difference in electricity consumption can be quite negligible.
The arguer presents us with the argument that the new technology would use less electricity but the arguer has not mentioned whether the new machinery can used to extract copper where the proportion of copper is low with the same electricity usage. There is a possibility that the new technology would use huge amount of electricity and may be even more than the old copper extraction technology.
The argument states that the copper is present in nature mixed with other minerals and their contents can vary considerably. The arguer fails to mention that if the content of copper in an ore is low then whether the new copper-extraction technology would work and if so then what would the electric consumption. The arguer has also not stated whether the new technology would help with any by products obtained in the process of extracting copper. The old technology might be helping with the by products.
The arguer has not mentioned the various relevant aspects in relation to the new copper-extraction technology. The cost of setting up the technology is not mentioned and also the difference in the cost of new and old technologies is not stated. It is quite possible that the cost of setting up is quite high and also the maintenance expenses are more which would make people old technology. The size of the machinery is also not known and if bulky it would become cumbersome to move the machine from one place to another.
The arguer has not given enough reasons to support the assumption that adoption of the new copper-extraction technology is more useful than the old one. The various arguments presented by the arguer are not convincing enough to make us believe that the new technology is better than the old one. The arguer needs to present more authentic and accurate arguments to support his stand.
