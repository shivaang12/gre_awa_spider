The following appeared in a letter to the editor of an archaeological magazine.
"""Archaeologists excavated a cave that had been inhabited by prehistoric people for thousands of years. These people hunted wild animals, many of whose bones were found at levels corresponding to different times of habitation. Most of the bones at the oldest levels, over 40,000 years old, were from a deer species whose modern-day descendants are known to prefer woodland habitats, whereas most of the bones at more recent levels, dating from 30,000 to 10,000 years ago, were from a gazelle species whose modern-day descendants are known to prefer grasslands. We can thus conclude that the climate of the area changed dramatically between 40,000 and 30,000 years ago, causing the terrain to change from woodland to grassland."""
"The above article appeared in a letter to the editor of an archaeological magazine. The arguer in the above argument is of the view that the dramatically changed climate between the 40,000 to 30,000 years caused the terrain to change from woodland to grassland. The arguer supports his argument through different reasons in the argument. The arguer states that the cave was inhabited by prehistoric people and they depended on hunting of wild animals. The bones found at the oldest level are of the deer species whose present day descendants prefer woodlands. The more recent level bones found match with the deer species whose descendants prefer grasslands.   Therefore, the arguer concludes that the climate changed dramatically causing the terrain to change. The arguer fails to make convincing arguments."
The various argument presented by the arguer are baseless. There is no relation between the climate change and hunting of animals by prehistoric people. The arguer fails to mention whether these two species of deer existed together or not and if they did then it is quite possible that the earlier people preferred hunting one species and the later ones preferred hunting the other deer species. It can be just the matter of change in taste of the prehistoric people. It is quite possible that the woodland and the grass existed together in those times so people were going to different places for hunting.
"The arguer takes support of the fact that the descendant deer species still preferred the same woodland and grassland. It is quite possible that in all these years there must have been change in the habitat of descendant deer species. The descendants of the older times deer now preferred opposite habitat due to the change in preference in food, or just that in so many years they preferred shifting from one terrain to another. Hence, it was not the climate but the animals that might have changed their habitat."
The arguer assumes that solely  the climate played a role in changing the terrain. It is quite possible that humans or animals had a great role to play in it as they were residing in the woodland and thus they destroyed large number of forest. The arguer only assumes that the change in terrain was the result of climate change. There is no evidence which the arguer presents to support his view point. This study is only based on the study of one single cave. There is a possibility that older bones were carried by the prehistoric people or animals from a different region. There are no other evidence that been found and only on the basis of the bones found it would not be justifiable to conclude that the climate was the sole culprit for the change in terrain.
The arguer fails to justify his stand and convince us. The arguer must provide us with more authentic study and evidence in support of his argument. The observation of the arguer falls short of relevant proof.
